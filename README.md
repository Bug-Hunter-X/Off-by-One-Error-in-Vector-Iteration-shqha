This repository demonstrates a common off-by-one error in C++ when iterating over a std::vector.  The bug.cpp file contains the erroneous code that accesses an element beyond the vector's bounds.  The bugSolution.cpp file provides the corrected version with the proper loop condition to avoid the error.  This is a classic example of a subtle bug that can lead to unexpected behavior and crashes, highlighting the importance of careful index management when working with arrays and vectors.
